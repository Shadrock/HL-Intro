# HL-Intro
This is an example for how to document code. This repo contains two pieces that accomplish some important things.
- [Sample_code.py](/sample_code.py): this can be used to accomplish x, y, and sometimes Z. It should be used in conjunction with the `DL_Fields_chatbot` markdown file.
- [DL_Fields_chatbot.md](DL_Fields_chatbot.md): this has important field level information for the code.

Taken together these two pieces of code do amazing, wonderous, things. 

Ideally, I'd have some set of steps listed here, or maybe a diagram, to show how the pieces of code should be run since they are not part of a unified script. But I'll save that for another day!
