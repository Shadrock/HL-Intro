# HL-Intro
This is an example for how to document code. This repo contains two pieces that accomplish some important things.
- [Sample_code.py](/sample_code.py): this can be used to accomplish x, y, and sometimes Z. It should be used in conjunction with the `DL_Fields_chatbot` markdown file.
- [DL_Fields_chatbot.md](DL_Fields_chatbot.md): this has important field level information for the code.

Taken together these two pieces of code do amazing, wonderous, things.
